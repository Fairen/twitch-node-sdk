# Twitch Node.js SDK

The Twitch Node.js SDK provides rich functionality for accessing the Twitch API. This includes Twitch Connect, which allows users to bring their Twitch accounts into your application. It is a fork of the official [Twitch JavaScript SDK](http://github.com/justintv/twitch-js-sdk), edited for use with Node.js, IO.js or NW.js.

To get started with the SDK please see [our wiki](https://github.com/Spiffyk/twitch-node-sdk/wiki).

For a detailed specification of API resources, see the [Twitch API wiki](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/wiki/API).
